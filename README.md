# SystemVerilog-BSA
Binary Search Algorithm implementation in SystemVerilog (binary_search.sv) to locate a value in a sorted ROM/RAM. The implementation follows directly from the ASMD chart attached.

The module was physically tested on a Terasic DE1 using the DE1_SoC.sv top-level module, interfacing binary_search.sv to rom32x8.v.
